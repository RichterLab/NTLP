    "# Overview\n",
    "This notebook provides the ability to generate random droplet parameters, write them to disk, and \n",
    "train a neural network with said droplet parameters to approximate the underlying ODEs that govern \n",
    "the droplet parameters.  Once trained researchers can generate a Fortran 90 module that provides \n",
    "the ability to estimate droplet radius and temperature for some time in the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The intent is that a small, reasonably trained neural network can provide accurate enough droplet \n",
    "characteristic estimations that are significantly faster than an iterative Gauss-Newton technique.\n",
    "Initial testing indicates a small 4-layer network (roughly 2400 parameters) with Fortran 90 module\n",
    "generated by this notebook is 30-90x faster than the existing (as of 2024/09/25) iterative approach \n",
    "which results in roughly a factor of 2x overall simulation speedup.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is broken down into the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ODEs of interest\n",
    "2. Mapping data to/from $[-1, 1]$\n",
    "3. Generating random droplets\n",
    "4. Training a neural network\n",
    "5. Analyzing a network's performance\n",
    "6. Exporting a network to Fortran 90\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup\n",
    "Since training a neural network to approximate ODEs has multiple workflows (e.g. training a model\n",
    "vs loading previous models to analyze their performance) there are several variables that need to\n",
    "be set to exercise all of this notebook's functionality.  In particular, the following should\n",
    "be reviewed and set depending on which workflows are of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loading a previously trained model: `load_model_flag`, `model_load_path`\n",
    "- Training a new model: `train_model_flag`, `training_data_path`, `number_epochs`\n",
    "- Saving a newly trained model: `save_model_path`\n",
    "\n",
    "These should be set at the top of the notebook.  Please adhere to the modification instructions\n",
    "where the variables are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Data\n",
    "Training data is not included in the repository due to size, though creating data on the fly\n",
    "using `create_training_file()` is slow since it is single threaded and this notebook does\n",
    "not implement a parallel data generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who have access to Dr. Richter's group network drive can download previously created \n",
    "data sets.  Users external to the group can either slowly create data using the tools in this \n",
    "notebook or use scripts exported from an earlier version of this notebook \n",
    "(`generate_training_data.py` and `loop-training-data.sh`) to generate data in bulk on\n",
    "multiple cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Dependencies\n",
    "The following Python packages are needed to exercise full functionality in this notebook \n",
    "(versions tested in parentheses):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python3 (3.11.5)\n",
    "- Matplotlib (3.7.1)\n",
    "- NumPy (1.24.3)\n",
    "- Pandas (1.5.3)\n",
    "- PyTorch (2.3.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no fundamental dependence on any particular version of the dependencies and, barring\n",
    "any bugs encountered with the packages' main APIs, newer versions are expected to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Notebook Care and Feeding\n",
    "Notebooks are great for exploring ideas and rapidly iterating to a solution.  They are less\n",
    "great for maintaining a \"production\" workflow that needs to be used by multiple people\n",
    "on a semi-regular basis.  As such, the following guidelines should be followed when making\n",
    "updates to this so as to preserve everyone's sanity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not commit the notebook with outputs from a previous run.  This greatly reduces the\n",
    "  file size in the repository and avoids unnecessary changes when someone re-runs a cell\n",
    "  whose output changes on each execution.\n",
    "- The notebook should always allow execution of all cells without errors.  Restarting the\n",
    "  kernel and running all cells should be run to confirm this (then restart and clear output).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameter Search on the Neural Network's Architecture\n",
    "The network architecture and hyperparameters were chosen because they:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Resulted in a small network\n",
    "2. Had sizes that *should be* efficient to work with on the CPU\n",
    "\n",
    "A very limited hyperparameter search has settled on parameters that appear to reliably train\n",
    "performant networks though the path from start to where we're at was very ad hoc.  Fiddling\n",
    "with hyperparameters stopped as soon as a network that was reasonably accurate (and was\n",
    "fairly reproducible) and fast enough when implemented in Fortran. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more thorough exploration of the following could be done in an attempt to generate a more accurate\n",
    "neural network, or a smaller (faster) network so more particles could be simulated without impacting\n",
    "simulation run-times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Areas to explore include (roughly in priority order):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Number and size of MLP-layers\n",
    "2. Learning rate and schedule\n",
    "3. Weights regularization (e.g. L1 or L2 penalties)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improving Neural Network Performance\n",
    "There are a handful of non-architecture/hyperparameter-related things to explore to improve\n",
    "performance.  Unless otherwise specified, these are all speculations on Greg's part and aren't\n",
    "a sure bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train on Sequences of Integration Times for the Same Parameter\n",
    "Currently training data \n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalize the Neural Networks's Integration Time Parameter\n",
    "Currently all of the neural network's inputs, except for integration time, are normalized into\n",
    "the range $[-1, 1]$.  Integration time remains in the range of $(0, 10)$ with a focus on $[10^{-3}, 10]$\n",
    "so as to cover both DNS and LES simulations.  The decision to leave integration time unnormalized\n",
    "was by accident rather than a conscious choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, it is unknown as to whether this negatively impacts the performance of the model.  Since\n",
    "DNS simulations focus on smaller time steps (in the range of $[10^{-3}, 10^{-1})$) and LES simulations on \n",
    "larger (in the range of $(10^{-1}, 10)$) it may be worthwhile to perform the same log-scale normalization\n",
    "to the integration time as is done for the droplet's radius and salinity.  The thought is that the\n",
    "network would be less sensitive to the scale separation between DNS and LES time steps and learn\n",
    "them equally.  That said, no quantitative analysis has been performed that would suggest this - it is\n",
    "purely an unfounded hypothesis at this point."
