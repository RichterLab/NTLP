module droplet_model

    ! Module containing a model of droplet size and temperature using a 4-layer
    ! multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network.  Once initialized, a single
    ! droplet's parameters and timestep can be used to estimate its future size
    ! and temperature.  This approach avoids an iterative search using
    ! Gauss-Newton to estimate its future charueacteristics and is typically much
    ! faster (O(30x) observed for small parameter count MLPs).
    !
    ! The module must be initialized with a call to initialize_model() and then
    ! droplet estimation, estimate(), can be performed as many times as
    ! necessary.  Weights for the MLP are hardcoded so initialization does not
    ! require any external resources.  An example calling sequence is the
    ! following:
    !
    !     ! Somewhere during simulation startup.
    !     call initialize_model()
    !
    !     ...
    !
    !     ! Particle simulation code.

    !
    ! Inputs to the estimation, as are outputs, are provided in physical units
    ! and are internally normalized before using the model allowing this to be a
    ! drop-in replacement for alternative approaches for estimating droplet
    ! characteristics.
    !
    ! The model was trained on droplet parameters sampled from the product space
    ! of each of the individual parameters.  While this simple approach allowed
    ! for rapid development of a prototype it does include combinations of
    ! parameters that may be physically impossible which may have been
    ! under-sampled during training.  As a result the estimations in these
    ! corners of the parameter space may be of lower accuracy than more sampled,
    ! better behaved regions of the space.  The initial parameter ranges were
    ! selected by David Richter during prototyping and aim to cover all
    ! simulations of interest.
    !
    ! Things to note:
    !
    !   1. This approach was developed for code that would operate on a single
    !      droplet at a time vs multiple droplets at once.  As a result the
    !      application of a MLP network is simply a series of matrix-vector
    !      multiplications, vector-vector additions, and an activation function
    !      applied to the result.  We implement this case rather than attempt to
    !      generalize as the performance gain is already non-trivial and it is
    !      unclear when the code (if ever) would support batch estimation.
    !
    !   2. We could statically initialize each layer's weights and biases at
    !      compile time, albeit at the expense of readability.  By separating
    !      the weights and biases' definitions from their values we retain the
    !      ability to understand the structure and internal components of the
    !      MLP while requiring a single subroutine call at startup.
    !
    !   3. This is a naive implementation of a 4-layer MLP (it was written in 15
    !      minutes!)  and does not implement all potential optimizations.  In
    !      particular, each intermediate layer has its own array and no attempt
    !      to reuse arrays or work out of one large array has been made, so as
    !      to minimize the MLP's run-time footprint.  As initially developed the
    !      MLP is very small (O(2500) parameters) and uses O(10 KiB) storage,
    !      though should this ever be used for much larger MLPs, or with larger
    !      batch sizes (see above) then some of the omitted optimizations should
    !      be revisited.
    !
    !   4. While the MLP was trained on the product space of the input
    !      parameters and has poor performance on certain (likely) physically
    !      impossible parameter combinations, it is unclear what need to be done
    !      to improve the situation.  Re-training on a subset of the input
    !      parameters might improve performance and could be done without
    !      changing this implementation (albeit with undefined behavior for any
    !      physically impossible input) but it remains to be seen how much
    !      accuracy would be gained from this.
    !
    !   5. This approach is *NOT* OpenMP safe and is inherently single-threaded!
    !      Should multiple estimations need to be performed in parallel, an
    !      additional interface is needed that provides the intermediate layers
    !      to the estimation subroutine.  All of the weights and biases are
    !      effectively read-only and can be shared across threads.  This is
    !      straight forward to implement though it was not necessary for the
    !      initial implementation.
    !
    !   6. Single precision floating point is used throughout the module as it
    !      has been deemed to produce an acceptable level of accuracy for the
    !      radius and temperature parameters.  The input and output arrays
    !      must be real*4.

    !       code!  Do not modify this unless you really know what you're doing!
