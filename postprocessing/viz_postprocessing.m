%The "viz file" contains slices of velocities and scalars
%The frequency that this is written out is governed by the "i_viz" paramater in params.in
%To see the contents of the file within Matlab, use the "ncdisp" command
%By default the slices are at the midplanes in each direction; to change, see the subroutine "write_viz_netcdf"

%"viz.nc" is a netCDF file which can be read using standard packages

% I modified this script to save each of the animations at 32 frames per second as an mp4 file in the folder that the .m file is run in. To change
% the framerate of all animations (and therefore the length as the number of frames is constant) change the variable called "fps" just below. To
% change the framerate of an individual animation, change the value of vidfile.FrameRate after the animation you want to affect to the desired
% framerate. DO NOT change the size of the figure while the animation is running as it will not write the .mp4 file. You can change the resolution
% in the figure object to change the resolution of the animation (it will be very large by default and may not show up on screen if your monitor is
% small)
